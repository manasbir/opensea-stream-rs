# opensea-stream

### added working trait and collection offers

Crate for receiving updates from the [OpenSea Stream API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/stream-api-overview).
This crate is a thin wrapper over [`phyllo`](https://crates.io/crates/phyllo) with a few convenience functions and struct definitions for the event schema.
It is recommended that you also read the documentation of [`phyllo`](https://crates.io/crates/phyllo) to understand the Phoenix protocol which delivers these messages.

## Example
The following example prints all listings of items in the `wandernauts` collection as they are created.
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut client = client(Network::Mainnet, "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE").await;

    // Subscribe to a collection. Note that you must all subscribe to all events
    // in the collection; filtering is your responsibility (see below).
    let (handler, mut subscription) = subscribe_to(
        &mut client,
        Collection::Collection("wandernauts".to_string()),
    )
    .await?;

    // To unsubscribe:
    // handler.close().await?;

    loop {
        // The message received from the channel is a raw message of the Phoenix protocol.
        // It may or may not contain a payload.
        let event = match subscription.recv().await?.into_custom_payload() {
            Some(v) => v,
            None => {
                eprintln!("unexpected message");
                continue;
            }
        };

        // Only print item listing events.
        if let schema::Payload::ItemListed(listing) = event.payload {
            println!("{:?}", listing);
        }
    }
}
```
## Features
`rustls-tls-native-roots` (which uses [`rustls-native-certs`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-native-certs)
for root certificates) is enabled by default. To use `rustls-tls-webpki-roots` ([`webpki-roots`](https://crates.io/crates/webpki-roots))
instead, include this in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
opensea-stream = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls-webpki-roots"] }
```
